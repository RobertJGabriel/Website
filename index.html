                    <h4>A Computer System</h4>
                    <p>This invention relates to a computer system and a method of operating the computer system. The system and method of the present invention are particularly suited to an environment such as a classroom environment or other environment where it is desirable to monitor and/or control the use of one or more computers.
                        </br>
                        The use of computers in schools is becoming more widespread. Many schools in developed countries have a dedicated computer room where there are provided a number of computers for use by the student body. In many cases, computer classes are incorporated into the curriculum to develop the computer literacy skills of the students.
                        </br>
                        Some commentators believe that, over time, the use of computers will replace the use of textbooks in the classroom. As the cost of computers fall, this is becoming closer to reality. It is envisaged by some that in the not-too-distant future, there will be a computer provided at each student’s station for use by that student during the lesson.
                        </br>
                        There are however a number of problems associated with the use of computers in the classroom. For example, often, the teacher is not in a position to view the content on the computer screen that the student is looking at or working on at a particular moment in time. It is quite possible that the student may be viewing content or engaged in an activity that is unrelated to the lesson or even contrary to school policy. Therefore, it is important to closely monitor and control the use of the computers. Secondly, heretofore there has not been provided a system or method that directly encourages or quantifies appropriate behaviour and discourages or quantifies inappropriate behaviour by the students.
                        </br>
                        It is an object of the present invention to provide a system and method that overcome at least some of the problems with the known systems and methods.</p>

                    <h4>Hatchery Scholarship</h4>
                    <p>Over the summer months in 2012 five student projects were developed into businesses by students who attended the Rubicon full-time. Over the summer they attended weekly training workshops, covering many topics, which enabled the student entrepreneurs to produce a completed business plan by September. The students received financial assistance from the School of Business, the School of Engineering and Science, the Department of Media Communications and from Crawford College of Art and Design. Expert mentors from industry provided on-going support to the students and they had fully serviced office space in the Rubicon Centre. The fledgling businesses took up residence in the on-campus incubator which give them invaluable training and exposure to the 57 start-up companies based in the Rubicon Centre. The second Hatchery Programme concluded in September 2012 when the students involved showcased their businesses and what they had achieved over the summer months. Now receiving a total of €22,500 funding to support the entrepreneurs, the programme is growing from strength to strength with an increase in the number of available places for 2013.</p>

The application was designed to connect individuals with a desire to exercise but found it hard to find people with a similar interest. Designed for use in large cities, it was designed to create a network of people for completing exercise. We received great feedback and support from Microsoft employees and management on the concept at a visit to Microsoft's offices in Dublin on the 23rd of April 2015. The Microsoft employees encouraged us to pursue the idea after the competition to a fully functional business. Until I have exhausted all avenues with the concept I am reluctant to give any more information on the idea.</p>
