                    | Following on from our success in 2014, I entered the Imagine Cup 2015 with a innovative exercise app called CrossTrainr. The application was designed to connect individuals with a desire to exercise but found it hard to find people
                    | with a similar interest. Designed for use in large cities, it was designed to create a network of people for completing exercise. We received great feedback and support from Microsoft employees and management on the concept
                    | at a visit to Microsoft's offices in Dublin on the 23rd of April 2015. The Microsoft employees encouraged us to pursue the idea after the competition to a fully functional business. Until I have exhausted all avenues with the
                    | concept I am reluctant to give any more information on the idea.
