The application was designed to connect individuals with a desire to exercise but found it hard to find people
with a similar interest. Designed for use in large cities, it was designed to create a network of people for completing exercise. We received great feedback and support from Microsoft employees and management on the concept
at a visit to Microsoft's offices in Dublin on the 23rd of April 2015. The Microsoft employees encouraged us to pursue the idea after the competition to a fully functional business. Until I have exhausted all avenues with the
concept I am reluctant to give any more information on the idea.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"><h2>Imagine Cup National Runner Up</h2><p>Microsoft Ireland</p><p>Developed a project called Yeti for the Microsoft Imagine Cup 2014.
