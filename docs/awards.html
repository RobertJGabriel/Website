The application was designed to connect individuals with a desire to exercise but found it hard to find people
with a similar interest. Designed for use in large cities, it was designed to create a network of people for completing exercise. We received great feedback and support from Microsoft employees and management on the concept
at a visit to Microsoft's offices in Dublin on the 23rd of April 2015. The Microsoft employees encouraged us to pursue the idea after the competition to a fully functional business. Until I have exhausted all avenues with the
concept I am reluctant to give any more information on the idea.<strong>Awarded By:</strong>Microsoft Ireland</p></div></li><li class="column is-half-tablet is-one-third-desktop"><div class="box"><div class="figure image"><img class="img-responsive" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sjmCRVBmuqQtrl3G0IcguNWQGiq3sYXy6Oopp_K5WsDy5sn5EG0bqgNlNMIbhny2Ei0pwQt2d7M=s1280-h800-e365-rw" alt="Loading image..."></div><h3 class="title is-3">Imagine Cup National Runner Up</h3><p class="subtitle is-6">Developed a project called Yeti for the Microsoft Imagine Cup 2014.
