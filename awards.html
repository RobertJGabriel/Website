The application was designed to connect individuals with a desire to exercise but found it hard to find people with a similar interest. Designed for use in large cities, it was designed to create a network of people for completing exercise. We received great feedback and support from Microsoft employees and management on the concept at a visit to Microsoft's offices in Dublin on the 23rd of April 2015. The Microsoft employees encouraged us to pursue the idea after the competition to a fully functional business. Until I have exhausted all avenues with the concept I am reluctant to give any more information on the idea.</p><p><strong>Awarded By: </strong>Microsoft Ireland</p><hr></li><li class="wide"><h3>Imagine Cup National Runner Up</h3><p>Developed a project called Yeti for the Microsoft Imagine Cup 2014.
