                <p>

                    Following on from our success in 2014, I entered the Imagine Cup 2015 with a innovative exercise app called CrossTrainr. The application was designed to connect individuals with a desire to exercise but found it hard to find people with a similar interest.
                    Designed for use in large cities, it was designed to create a network of people for completing exercise. We received great feedback and support from Microsoft employees and management on the concept at a visit to Microsoft's offices
                    in Dublin on the 23rd of April 2015. The Microsoft employees encouraged us to pursue the idea after the competition to a fully functional business. Until I have exhausted all avenues with the concept I am reluctant to give any more
                    information on the idea.

                    I totally forgot about this. For a local computation called Scifest , I built a tablet out of an old laptop. Added a touch screen panel, progammed a interface and bunch of apps for it. Then made a custom shell for it. It was madness but I can second place.
                    Won the Abbott award.
