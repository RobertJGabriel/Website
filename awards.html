                <p>

                    Following on from our success in 2014, I entered the Imagine Cup 2015 with a innovative exercise app called CrossTrainr. The application was designed to connect individuals with a desire to exercise but found it hard to find people with a similar interest.
                    Designed for use in large cities, it was designed to create a network of people for completing exercise. We received great feedback and support from Microsoft employees and management on the concept at a visit to Microsoft's offices
                    in Dublin on the 23rd of April 2015. The Microsoft employees encouraged us to pursue the idea after the competition to a fully functional business. Until I have exhausted all avenues with the concept I am reluctant to give any more
                    information on the idea.

                    Over the summer months in 2012 five student projects were developed into businesses by students who attended the Rubicon full-time. Over the summer they attended weekly training workshops, covering many topics, which enabled the student entrepreneurs
                    to produce a completed business plan by September. The students received financial assistance from the School of Business, the School of Engineering and Science, the Department of Media Communications and from Crawford College of Art
                    and Design.

                    I totally forgot about this. For a local computation called Scifest , I built a tablet out of an old laptop. Added a touch screen panel, progammed a interface and bunch of apps for it. Then made a custom shell for it. It was madness but I can second place.
                    Won the Abbott award.
