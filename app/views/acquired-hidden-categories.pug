          | Back in May 2018 almost eight months now, when I decided to take a few months out and travel the world, explore new areas of engineering and to relax and rewind and become unburnt. 
          | I got to travel the world with my fiancee, built amazing tools and products and communities with a total of 200,000 daily users.

          | Today, I'm delighted and honoured thrilled to announce that Hidden categories for Chrome and Firefox have been acquired by Ontario Ltd for the tooling and community around it.
        p
          | The tool itself adds a suite of features to existing streaming services. Check out the Chrome extension and Firefox extension.
        p
          | I love  all users trying out and using  Hidden categories for Chrome and Firefox. 
        p
          | I couldnâ€™t believe that it had grown to over 5,000 daily users. 
        p
          | I also want to thank everyone who invested and used this through open source contributions, Pro memberships and daily usage. 
          | I couldn't achieve this goal without the help of mentors and friends who guided me. Hopefully the first of many products being acquired.
