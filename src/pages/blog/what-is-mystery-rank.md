Hey everyone,

I wanted to share something close to my heart that I’ve been working on lately—it’s called [Mystery Rank](https://www.coffeeandfun.com/forever-advert/). The idea behind it is simple but carries a bit of mischief, which I absolutely love. 

If you know me, you know I’m always up for a bit of fun and experimentation, especially when it comes to pushing software in new directions. That’s exactly what Coffee and Fun is all about—trying new things, challenging the norm, and seeing where a little bit of creativity can take us.

## The Website: Where the Mischief Happens

The website is live, and this is where the real fun begins. You can discover it here. The concept is straightforward yet full of intrigue: contribute to secure your spot in various categories on the site, and the more you contribute, the higher your rank. 

But here’s the twist—no one knows what others have paid. That’s what makes it a true [Mystery Rank](https://www.coffeeandfun.com/forever-advert/). It’s all about the excitement of not knowing and the friendly competition that comes with it.

## Stickers Across the USA

I’ve taken my love for mischief one step further with this project. I’ve created some pretty cool stickers, and I’m planning a little adventure across the USA to place them in unexpected spots—think quirky coffee shops, community boards, and random places around town. 

Each sticker has a QR code that leads straight to the [Mystery Rank](https://www.coffeeandfun.com/forever-advert/) website. It’s like a little scavenger hunt, but instead of finding hidden treasure, you’re discovering where you rank in the credits.

The idea is to make people curious, to give them a little nudge to join in on the fun. If you happen to spot one of these stickers, I’d love it if you could snap a pic and share it on social media. Let’s see how far we can spread the word and how many people we can get involved in the mystery!

## Why I’m Doing This
So why all the effort? Well, because it’s fun! I’ve always believed in the power of playfulness, and I think there’s something really special about blending mischief with creativity. 

Coffee and Fun is my way of experimenting with software, pushing the boundaries, and seeing what happens when you mix a little bit of chaos with a lot of imagination. [Mystery Rank](https://www.coffeeandfun.com/forever-advert/) is just one of those experiments—a way to make the internet a little more fun and a lot more mysterious.

If you’re into trying new things, pushing limits, and enjoying a bit of friendly competition, then [Mystery Rank](https://www.coffeeandfun.com/forever-advert/) is for you. Whether you’re looking to secure your own spot or just curious to see what it’s all about, I’d love for you to check out the website. And who knows? Maybe you’ll be the next top contributor!

Thanks for being part of this journey, and happy ranking!

Cheers,
Robert James Gabriel
