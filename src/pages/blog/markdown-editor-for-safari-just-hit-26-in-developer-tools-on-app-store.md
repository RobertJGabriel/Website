I'm really excited to share some good news. My extension, [Markdown Editor for Safari](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/markdown-editor-for-safari/id6578456621), has climbed up to #26 in the Developer Tools category on the Apple App Store!

This isn’t just a direct copy of my old extension; it’s a full rebuild. I poured a lot of time and effort into making sure it’s a smooth, user-friendly experience for anyone who loves working with Markdown. So, seeing it get recognized like this really makes me proud.

For those who haven’t checked it out yet, the extension lets you write, edit, and preview Markdown right in Safari. Whether you’re coding, writing, or just enjoying the simplicity of Markdown, it’s a handy tool to have.

A big thank you to everyone who’s [downloaded it](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/markdown-editor-for-safari/id6578456621) so far. Your support means a lot, and it’s what keeps me motivated to keep improving and adding new features. If you haven’t tried it out yet, I’d love for you to give it a go!

Here’s to reaching even more milestones together!
