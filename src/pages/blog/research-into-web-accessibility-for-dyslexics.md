<h1 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-2xl" id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  There are few published papers about usability testing with dyslexia focused
  fonts, but there is a considerable collection of knowledge on dyslexia as well
  as many suggestions for authoring dyslexia friendly interfaces. Existing
  accessibility guidelines for dyslexic and non-dyslexic users suggest that
  dyslexic-accessible practices may redress difficulties encountered by all
  Internet users. This paper reviews two existing papers about dyslexia focused
  fonts (OpenDyslexia font) and accessibility.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  It will examine the font itself, as well as how the use of the font affects
  the visual perception, readability, and comprehension of the website and text
  with general web accessibility. The report is interested in the effects the
  font has, if any, for people with dyslexia, in comparison with those of Comic
  Sans or Times New Roman, and on improving human- computer interactions.
</p>
<h1 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-2xl" id="typography">Typography</h1>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  It is necessary to be familiar with the particulars of typography in order to
  understand the importance of font use in web accessibility. Typography is the
  technique of arranging text for print or on screens for aesthetics and
  readability. It involves the use of different font types, faces, sizes and
  layout restrictions such as line height, column width and spacing between
  characters and colors. Typography has been around for thousands of years, from
  stone tablets right through history up to the GUI (graphical user interface).
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  In the context of human-computer interaction, typography has critical
  importance in some applications. The primary purpose of a significant
  proportion of websites and web applications (web apps) is to display/render
  textual content. Included in this are instructions, labels, and navigation for
  the web app which can be presented in text (web icons or symbols are in fact a
  font), and must be readable for users to have fruitful and efficient
  interactions with the application.

  Key Typography Terms
</h2>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  Font face describes the overall letter form, for example, Comic Sans or Times
  New Roman. Font faces may have serifs (a slight projection finishing off a
  stroke of a letter in certain typefaces such as Times New Roman) or may be
  sans serif (Don&#39;t use serifs which are small lines at the ends/tips of
  characters such as in Comic Sans).
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  <img src="/assets/img/talks/sans.webp" alt="open dyslexica" />
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  Fonts may be display fonts, designed for headlines, or text fonts, designed
  for large bodies of smaller text.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  When measuring font size, there are two key areas to focus on:<br /><strong
    >The body size:</strong
  >
  Measures the full height of letters, from the bottom of the descenders (the
  part of the character that lies below the baseline) to the top of the
  ascenders (the part of the character that lies above the baseline) and three
  additional gutter spaces above and below .
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  <strong>X-Height:</strong> The top of the main body height of lowercase
  letters excluding the spacing or ascenders or descenders. X-Height is a huge
  factor in typeface regarding readability.

<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">The following graphic summarizes the key parts:</p>

  What is OpenDyslexia
</h1>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  OpenDyslexia is a free font face designed to mitigate some of the common
  reading errors caused by dyslexia. It was made with the goal of helping with
  some of the symptoms of dyslexia. The font is based on the concept that the
  letters have heavily weighted bottoms to indicate direction. This aids in
  recognizing the correct letter and which part of the letter is down as it
  helps your brain from rotating them. Consistently weighted bottoms can also
  contribute to reinforcing the line of text.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  The unique shape of each letter in the OpenDyslexia font can help prevent
  confusion through flipping and swapping as the font is unlike that of other
  fonts the brain is has seen before.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">As you can see below.</p>

<h1 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-2xl" id="the-history-of-opendyslexia-s-development">
  The History of OpenDyslexia’s Development
</h1>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  The font was created by a dyslexic and software developer Abelardo Gonzalez,
  who released it under an open-source license. The design for the font is based
  on that of DejaVu Sans, also open-source.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  Like many dyslexia-intervention font-faces, most notably Dyslexia or even
  DejaVu Sans, OpenDyslexia furthers the research of Dyslexia. It is more of a
  reading aid, but it is to be noted that this is not a cure for dyslexia even
  though it is very popular. The typeface includes regular, bold, italic,
  bold-italic, and monospaced font styles. In 2012, Gonzalez explained his
  motivation to the BBC: &quot;I had seen similar fonts, but at the time they
  were completely unaffordable and so impractical as far as costs go.”
</p>
<h1 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-2xl" id="the-theory-on-opendyslexia">
  The Theory on OpenDyslexia
</h1>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  The OpenDyslexia font uses heavy weighted bottoms to the font, this, in
  theory, will figure out fast which part of the letter is down. This helps in
  spotting the correct letter and sometimes contributes to keeping the users
  brain from rotating them around. Consistently weighted bottoms can also
  contribute to reinforcing the line of text. The unique shapes of each letter
  can help prevent confusion through flipping and swapping.
</p>
<h1 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-2xl" id="pre-existing-studies-on-opendyslexia">
  Pre-existing Studies on OpenDyslexia
</h1>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  There are many reports of the positive impacts of using OpenDyslexia in both
  traditional media and the within online forms and schools. Currently, as of 7
  February 2016, there is no research paper or text-based paper on the effect of
  the OpenDyslexia that shows OpenDyslexia to be effective with English readers
  with dyslexia.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  One study by Boyarski in 1998 examined the varying features of legacy fonts
  and modern typefaces designed for digital displays. This study wasn&#39;t
  planned to determine which fonts were better than others regarding
  readability. It did offer a scientific way to discern which features of new
  typefaces affect readability. This scientific method has been used by other
  researchers in their investigations of the links between typography and
  readability for dyslexics.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  Currently, two major studies have investigated the effect of specialized fonts
  with students with dyslexia. One paper by Rello and Baeza-Yates written in
  2013 titled Good Fonts for Dyslexia, examined the effects of fonts, namely
  OpenDyslexia, Arial, Times New Roman and Comic Sans on the reading time and
  eye fixation (i.e. squinting and returning to particular points on a page to
  double check) of a group of dyslexic subjects from the ages of 12-59. [2] They
  found that OpenDyslexia did not hugely improve reading time nor reduce eye
  fixation when reading and processing text.

>
  Fonts for Dyslexia - Rello and Baeza-Yates’ Paper
</h2>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  In the paper co-authored by Rello, Rello noted that dyslexia is a visual
  reading disability. It is characterized by having difficulties with fluent
  word recognition and commonly having poor spelling. Also, in the paper it is
  estimated to affect 10% of the population in the US has dyselxia. During her
  research for the paper, Rello looked into how different algorithms could be
  used to replace words with more common synonyms that are hard or confusing for
  dyslexics.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  Rello also investigated the possibility of using eye tracking and facial
  expression analysis to discover problem areas on the internet for dyslexics
  and to test the impact of key interface design elements on sample groups of
  people with dyslexia. The list of variables stated in Rello&#39;s experiments
  was very complete: paragraph spacing, character spacing, line spacing, font
  size, type, column width, gray scales colour pairs.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  A summarized version of Rello&#39;s findings is presented in an upcoming paper
  in which Rello details visual details that make reading online much easier for
  dyslexics, for example, Rello learned that the larger the font size, the
  better, up to a point. &quot;’14 pt.’ seemed to be the optimal setting&quot;
  Rello stated. Another significant highlight from the paper was font types;
  Rello concluded that italics tended to have an enormous negative impact. Rello
  noticed that sans serif, monospaced and Roman font styles significantly
  improved the reading performance of those with dyslexia.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  Rello stated in the report, that the use of the fonts Helvetica, OpenDyslexia
  ,Courier and Computer Modern Unicode are excellent typefaces to make sure your
  website is dyslexia- friendly, because they are sans serif and their simple,
  clean design is very easy for the dyslexic eye to process, as it doesn&#39;t
  have the curves at the end of the tips of the font to cause confusion of
  processing the text on a webpage.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  Despite the fact that there were already dozens of available fonts claiming to
  be dyslexia- friendly, none of them had the backing of scientific proof.
  Rello’s study was one of the first times that HCI techniques were used to
  investigate the effects of key aspects of type design on readability for
  dyslexics, thus providing the basis for designing a font which could
  potentially make the internet a dyslexia-friendly space.
</p>
<h2 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-2xl" id="special-fonts-for-dyslexia-renskede-leeuws">
  Special Fonts for Dyslexia - RenskeDe Leeuws
</h2>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  In the second paper, masters student Renske de Leeuw (2010) compared Arial
  with the font Dyslexie (Dyslexie is a typeface/font designed to mitigate some
  of the issues that dyslexics experience when reading. It was developed by
  Dutch graphic designer Christian Boer while in college to help combat her own
  dyslexia). Rello took 21 Dutch students with dyslexia as her sample group,
  gave them texts to read in both fonts and monitored the differences in reading
  speed and accuracy the fonts produced.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  Rello found that Dyslexie did not lead to quicker reading, however it did help
  some students make less dyslexia-related errors, another inserting aspect was
  from the questionnaires. Renske found that users wouldn’t use the font,
  because other people, who would have to read their work, would not like the
  font. This gives the impression that dyslectics are adapting to others,
  instead of ask for understanding of the use of an adapted font, so that a
  dyslectic can cope with his/her handicap .Overall the dyslectics read fewer
  errors while reading the words printed in the font “Dyslexie”.
</p>
<h2 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-2xl" id="results-of-the-papers">
  Results of the Papers
</h2>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  While there is currently a lack of definite evidence that a dyslexia-friendly
  font can make a difference to reading rate and accuracy for students with
  dyslexia, the results of the papers do suggest that these fonts might improve
  accuracy for dyslexic students if not reading times: further research is
  needed to determine whether this is actually the case. However, it is clear
  that the variable design elements of fonts impact dyslexic students in some
  way, therefore the creation of an effective dyslexia-friendly font should be
  possible, if there were enough research to indicate which elements have
  negative or positive effects.

  id="the-effect-of-optimal-colours-on-readability"

  The Effect of Optimal Colours on Readability
</h1>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  Another important area in web accessibility is colour. This is dealt with in
  the research report by the W3C communities (Web developers who make the W3C
  specifications).
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  In the study, they analyze how the aspects of text customization, text and
  background colours can improve readability for people with dyslexia, through
  different colour mixes and brightness levels. In previous studies, it came to
  light that particular text and background colour combinations can be
  beneficial for reading on the screen for those with dyslexia.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  Several text customization suggestions agree that users with dyslexia prefer
  lower brightness colour differences between the text and the background
  compared to the average user (British Dyslexia Association, 2012). It must be
  noted that no studies have been carried out upon the relationship between this
  preference and the minimum colour luminosity ratio which the W3C suggested
  would be suitable for dyslexic users.
</p>
<h2 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-2xl" id="w3c-study">W3C Study</h2>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  In the study taken by the W3C, they got 200 people and showed them several
  pieces of text with different color combinations and asked them which they
  preferred to read along with reading time. They then tested previous
  recommendations and compared them with the W3C algorithm (The W3C algorithm
  suggests avoidance of brightness differences less than 125 and colour
  differences less than 500). The user performance and preferences from the
  tests, among the different colour values across people with and without
  dyslexia are shown in the chart below.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TzZ6i.webp" alt="open dyslexica" />
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  In the report, the areas of focus were broken down as follows:
</p>
<ol>
  <li class="mt-8 mb-8 text-lg">The performance, measured in reading time.</li>
  <li class="mt-8 mb-8 text-lg">
    Preferences, represented by the percentage of participants who chose certain
    colours.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-2xl" id="eye-movement-performance-">
  Eye movement (Performance)
</h2>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  Shorter fixations are preferred to longer ones, as according to other studies,
  readers pause longer at points where processing loads are larger. In their
  results, it was evident the greatest difference among groups is on the black
  and white pair, as seen in the chart. Most of the users tested who didn&#39;t
  have dyslexia (32.5%) preferred a colour mixture and only 13.5% of people with
  dyslexia choose black text on white background in terms of text.
</p>
<h2
  class="mt-4 mb-4 text-2xl"
  id="accessibility-needs-and-personal-preferences-and-testing"
>
  Accessibility needs and Personal Preferences and Testing
</h2>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  The testing approach is designed so that accessibility needs and personal
  preferences can be studied separately, rather than being mixed up as they
  frequently are in recommendations regarding colours and readability.<br />The
  tests were composed of two parts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li class="mt-8 mb-8 text-lg">
    Set of texts to be read with the use of the eye-tracking to study the
    reading performance.
  </li>
  <li class="mt-8 mb-8 text-lg">
    A survey to collect the user&#39;s preferences.
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  The benefit of this separation is that they could see whether there was a
  difference in reading speed and accuracy before and after colour
  customisation, which in turn allowed them to determine trends in colour
  choice.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  It must also be noted that during these experiments, the colour pairs were
  displayed randomly rather than in order of brightest to darkest or vice versa,
  because that would have allowed the subjects’ eyes to adjust to each setting
  and it they would not have been able to make a judgment as to which colours
  are most advantageous to their reading.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  <strong>Possible problems with the tests include:</strong>
</p>
<ul class="ml-8">
  <li class="mt-8 mb-8 text-lg">
    The texts used are too small to draw firm conclusions.
  </li>
  <li class="mt-8 mb-8 text-lg">
    The texts were alone on the screen. Thus, the researchers couldn&#39;t
    predict the effect of colour differences in other reading contexts such as
    web browsing, where there are multiple colour schemes on the page.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-2xl" id="results-of-study">Results of Study</h2>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  The outcome of the results from the paper (see figure 1) did not match the WC3
  algorithm. Brown and Dark presented high fixation for both groups; that was
  second and third highest for people without and with dyslexia. These colours
  were also hardly selected by the users, with only 4.55% without dyslexia and
  0.99% of the users with dyslexia.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  However, one surprising outcome of the study was that the pairing of dark
  brown and light green, which is very similar to the brown and dark green pair
  in terms of the colour hue but different in terms of brightness and colour
  contrast, presented the lowest and second lowest fixations duration for people
  with dyslexia and without dyslexia.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  The results suggest that text customization preferences need to be
  complemented by measured data from actual reading performance since there is
  no correlation observed between the reading performance and the personal
  choices of users with dyslexia.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  In the research it was also reported that the use of colours should be taken
  into consideration by UX developers. It was even noted that if the users with
  dyslexia seem to be reading more quickly using lower colour contrasts than the
  control group of users these are not below the W3C algorithm, which is to
  avoid brightness differences less than 125 and color differences less than
  500.
</p>
<h1 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-2xl" id="my-research">My Research</h1>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  In my own research, I followed the methods used in the other papers, in order
  to discover if my results might back up their findings.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  I developed a survey, which consisted of 12 questions ranging from details
  such as age to the colour combinations they preferred to use. I also showed
  them samples of Ariel and Comic Sans alongside samples of OpenDyslexia and
  asked them to pick the one they preferred, similar to the method from Renske
  De Leeuw’s paper.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  In total, I got 43 people to take the survey by posting the link on Reddit sub
  categories for both dyslexia and web design. I allowed for a section for
  personal comments so that I could get a better understanding of what the user
  thought of the fonts. One user wrote &quot; I don&#39;t like using
  OpenDyslexia all the time because I feel like It&#39;s not very discreet,
  using it would be immediately obvious to everyone that I was ‘different.’”
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  For the most part, the results followed the same patterns as that of the
  papers cited, with the exception of the W3C study, where the results were
  mixed, as dyslexia is different from person to person. The people who were
  surveyed did not stick to the standard 12px body but preferred the 14px body
  size which was inline with the recommendation of that from Rellos paper.

<h1 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-2xl" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  The results of the existing research and the research of this paper into
  dyslexic focused fonts in terms of web accessibility for dyslexics can be put
  into effect by developers to improve the readability of their applications in
  both software, website or web application for those with dyslexia.
</p>
<h2 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-2xl" id="web-accessibility-recommendations">
  Web accessibility recommendations
</h2>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  Some recommendations from the above mentioned papers include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li class="mt-8 mb-8 text-lg">
    Choose a common font with recognizable letter forms for large bodies of
    text, such the OpenDyslexia font, comic sans or Arial.
  </li>
  <li class="mt-8 mb-8 text-lg">Include the option for different fonts</li>
  <li class="mt-8 mb-8 text-lg">
    Allow the user to choose between colour combinations
  </li>
  <li class="mt-8 mb-8 text-lg">
    Set the body text size to least 14px, instead of the existing 12px.
  </li>
  <li class="mt-8 mb-8 text-lg">
    Present blocks of texts in columns; don’t let text span the entire length of
    the screen on a widescreen display, allowing for better use of whitespace.
  </li>
  <li class="mt-8 mb-8 text-lg">
    Choose text and background colours with a high luminance contrast, or better
    yet allow the user to select the combination.
  </li>
  <li class="mt-8 mb-8 text-lg">
    Use lower case letters. Avoid the use of capital letters. Using all capital
    letters make it harder to read for people with dyslexia.
  </li>
  <li class="mt-8 mb-8 text-lg">Double spacing after periods.</li>
  <li class="mt-8 mb-8 text-lg">
    Avoid pure black text on a pure white background (Many dyslexic users can be
    sensitive to the brightness the high contrast colours cause, as stated in
    the W3C report as well.)
  </li>
  <li class="mt-8 mb-8 text-lg">
    Avoid Serif fonts ( A sans-serif font would allow dyslexic users to see the
    shapes of letters more clearly. This is because of the lack of hooks
    increases the spacing between letters and makes them more distinguishable.
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  As is evident from the suggestions, there are multiple possible avenues for
  future studies on typography for dyslexic users, and in fact, such research is
  desperately needed in order to create a web which is universally accessible.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  Despite the fact that the research papers cited and lack of existing research
  do not offer concrete evidence of a correlation between readability for
  dyslexic users and the use of dyslexia-focused fonts, there are so many people
  suffering from dyslexia and even more having trouble reading on the web, that
  web designers and developers should feel obliged to make their websites
  accessible to everyone by fixing bad practices or at least considering the
  above mentioned suggestions. Aside from developing more user friendly fonts,
  true web accessibility entails always providing users with several options so
  that they can customize the website to suit their needs.
</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
  This report should offer an insight into the way dyslexic users experience the
  web and demonstrate how dyslexic focus fonts try to fix some of their problems
  and improve web accessibility in general.
