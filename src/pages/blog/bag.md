# What's this about?

I recently read a book about the minimal life. I'm no hipster, and I am a privileged, white Irish man. So, I don't have to worry about some things and have savings and a job. I thought I would write about what I need to do my day-to-day life.

I recently came across an article on Medium, and it kind of inspired me to redo this.
