My Journey with a Rare Eye Teratoma: A Plain-Spoken Tale

</h2>


<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">

Hey there. I've decided to share something quite personal with you all, something I've been dealing with for a while now. It's about this unusual medical condition I found out I had a few years back, around 2017/2018. It's called a teratoma, and it was located in the temple of my right eye. I want to talk about what that's been like, the worries that came with it, and where I am now.

</p>


<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">

First off, what's a teratoma? Well, in simple terms, it's a tumor that's pretty out of the ordinary because it can contain different types of tissue, like hair, teeth, and even muscle. Yeah, it sounds like something from a sci-fi movie, but it's real. And when you have one of these near your eye, it's not just rare; it's a big deal because it can cause serious problems, like affecting your vision or even being life-threatening if it turns out to be cancerous.

</p>


<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">


Finding a surgeon who could remove this thing was a massive challenge, especially with the whole world turned upside down by COVID-19. It took until 2024 to get it sorted, with Dr. Bryan Wilkins stepping up to do the surgery. The tumor was successfully removed, and yeah, it was as weird as it sounds â€” teeth and hair included.

</p>


<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">


After the surgery, I couldn't move my eyebrow, which was a bit of a shock, but it's something that will get better over time. There's also a scar to show for it, but the biggest relief is knowing that the tumor is gone. The whole experience, though, was a rollercoaster of emotions, not just for me but for my family and some friends I shared this with.

<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">

My wife, my parents, and a few friends were pretty worried throughout this whole ordeal. And who could blame them? We were all on edge, waiting for test results to come back, hoping the teratoma wasn't cancerous. The uncertainty of it all was probably the hardest part to deal with.


</p>


<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">

Looking back, I kept a lot of the fear and anxiety to myself. I didn't want to pile on more worry for my loved ones. But now, I feel it's important to talk about it, to share my story in case someone else is going through something similar. It's okay to be scared, and it's okay to lean on others for support.


</p>


<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">


Teratomas, especially in places like near your eye, are no joke. They can be dangerous, and the waiting game for test results can really mess with your head. But here I am, tumor-free and feeling a lot lighter, even if I'm still waiting for my eyebrow to catch up.
</p>


<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">

If you're dealing with your own health scares, just remember, you're not alone. It's tough, and it's okay to feel all the feels. Reach out, share your story, and let's support each other through these weird, scary moments in life.
