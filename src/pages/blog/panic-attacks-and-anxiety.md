My Journey with Panic Attacks
</h2>

<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
Hey there! ðŸ˜Š Today, I want to share something deeply personalâ€”my ongoing journey with panic attacks. Writing about my experiences helps me process them, and I hope that by sharing my story, I might connect with and help some of you who may be facing similar challenges.

The Unexpected Return of Anxiety
</h2>

<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">

Iâ€™ve had my fair share of panic attacks over the years. The last significant wave hit back in 2018, and I thought I had it under control. But recently, anxiety has made an unwelcome return. For those who havenâ€™t experienced it, imagine being in a room full of friends or family and suddenly feeling an intense sense of doom. Thoughts like, "No one likes me," or "Everything I say sounds stupid," flood your mind. Iâ€™ve had countless moments where I was too afraid to speak up, convinced that no one cared about what I had to say.

<h2 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-2xl">
The Height of My Anxiety
</h2>

<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">

Letâ€™s rewind to 2017, a year when my anxiety reached its peak. I had just been promoted to a manager position at a tech company. While it was an exciting step in my career, it also came with immense pressure and expectations. I often stayed at the office until 11 PM, not because I had more work than usual, but because I felt I wasnâ€™t doing enough. The anxiety of facing another challenging day made it nearly impossible to sleep. Iâ€™d often get just an hour of restless sleep before waking up at 8 AM to start the cycle all over again. 

<br>
During this time, I felt a profound sense of worthlessness. The mere thought of planning to meet friends for drinks or meals filled me with such overwhelming anxiety and dread that I would make excuses to avoid it. Instead of enjoying time with friends, I found myself sitting alone in coffee shops, watching life go by, regretting how my mental health struggles were making me miss out on so many moments.

A New Chapter in 2024
</h2>

<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">

Fast forward to 2024, and a lot has changed in my life. Iâ€™m now married to an incredible woman, and Helperbird, my project, is making a difference for over 900,000 people every week. My new venture, Coffee & Fun, is exploring exciting new technologies. I have wonderful friends both back in Ireland and here in the USA.

Tingling Hands and Overwhelming Dread
</h2>

<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">

But despite all these positives, the past few weeks have been tough. Iâ€™ve been waking up with tingling hands and a heavy feeling of dread in my stomach, and all I want to do is go back to bed. This might be the stress from house hunting and the pressures of being self-employed, but I know something isnâ€™t right. This creeping anxiety is different from what Iâ€™ve experienced before. Itâ€™s more insidious, slowly taking over my mornings and making even simple tasks feel overwhelming. The tingling in my hands is a constant reminder that something is off, and the dread in my stomach makes it hard to find joy in my daily activities. Itâ€™s like a dark cloud hanging over my head, and some days, it feels almost impossible to shake off. The anxiety has been so intense that Iâ€™ve felt like crying and found myself not wanting to do any work. Iâ€™ve also recently started learning to drive again and Iâ€™m determined not to let this anxiety interrupt my progress.


</p>
<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">
Thatâ€™s why, after years of trying to control it myself and keeping these feelings to myself, Iâ€™ve decided to make an appointment with my doctor. Iâ€™m hoping to start medication to help manage this overwhelming sense of dread and anxiety. I have so much to be thankful for, and I donâ€™t want this anxiety to hold me back any longer.

Sharing My Story
</h2>

<p class="mt-8 mb-8 text-xl">

I decided to share my story because I know Iâ€™m not alone. Many people in the tech field struggle with anxiety, and itâ€™s crucial to talk about it openly. My goal is to eventually wrap up my work with Helperbird and set it on a steady course so I can focus on getting my mental health back on track. I want everyone to know that itâ€™s okay to seek help and take steps to improve your well-being. We all deserve to live our lives fully, without being held back by anxiety.
