        I'm Robert James Gabriel, hailing from the vibrant landscapes of
        Ireland. I've always had a knack for tech and a deep fascination with
        programming, a journey that started early and has taken me down some
        incredible paths.

        Living with dyslexia has shaped a lot of my work. It's not just a
        personal challenge; it's been a driving force behind my mission to make
        the digital world more accessible. That's where<a

        My work isn't all behind the screen, though. I love getting out there,
        engaging with people, sharing my story and insights – speaking gigs are
        a bit of a rush for me. And hey, it seems to resonate with folks,
        considering I landed a spot on the

        Now, let's talk about my other love – coffee. It's not just a beverage
        for me; it's like a ritual, a source of inspiration. And in between
        sips, I'm usually hammering out my thoughts in a blog post, which I
        update
